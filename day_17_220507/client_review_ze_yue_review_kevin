Client review
Program author : Kevin
Client : Ze Yue

Features :
Plot shape ✓
Calculate perimeter (2D shapes) ✓
Calculate area ✓
Calculate volume (3D shapes) ✓
Fill color ✓

In all my testing, no errors with the functionality has been found


UI :
UI is very clear and easy to understand, makes using the application very enjoyable. There might be a little too much
superfluous text that do not help the functionality, but some people like to have more details.


User friendliness :
Application is pretty easy to use, although I've encountered a slight problem using it for the first time : I entered
the color filling menu without having plotted a shape, so I did not have any options. It did not show me an option to
exit and when I entered a random number, it crashed the program. Overall pretty good though.


My decision : Accept
